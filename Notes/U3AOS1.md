## Research methods

### P-values

P = (number) means that the probability that the difference between the groups (experimental and control) is due to chance alone is equal to (number) in 100. If the acceptable significance level is p ≤ (number) then this result is (not) significant and the hypothesis is (not) supported.

### Requirements for generalisations of research to a population

- Must be an experiment
- Must have a representative population
- Result must be statistically significant and in the right direction

## States of consciousness
### Consciousness

*Consciouness* - Consciousness is the awareness of objects and events in the external world and of our own existence and mental experiences at any given moment.

#### The conscious experience can be described in the following ways:

- Personal - Consciousness contains an individuals sense of self, and as a result is highly subjective and personal to each person.
- Selective - Since you may voluntarily shift your focus away from certain things, the consciousness experience can be described as selective
- Continuous - Consciousness can never be empty or nil
- Changing - New information is constantly pouring into mind, leading it to new conclusions and views

---

### States of consciousness

#### Qualities of states of consciousness include:
##### Level of awareness
Attention is a concentration of mental activity that involves focusing on a specific stimulus while ignoring other stimuli. This concerntration may be focussed internally (such as on thoughts and feelings) or externally (such as on a person you're talking to). Shifts in attention can be both intentional and unintentional. For example you may intentionally stop reading a book and instead go watch TV (intentional change), or your phone may ring while you're studying (unintentional change). As level of awareness is a criterion for a state of consciousness, as your level of awareness changes, your conscious awareness changes.

Generally, there are two levels of awareness:

###### Selective attention
Selective attention involves choosing and attending to a specific stimulus to the exclusion of others. It is generally associated with tasks that are complex or require a large amount of cognitive effort. Examples include learning to driving or a comprehension on a story just read to you. Selective attention is required for any controlled process.

When a stimulus is determined to be personally important to us, we are more likely to notice it. An example of this behaviour in action is the 'cocktail party effect'. If you are at a party with loud music and talking to a group of friends, you may find your attention suddenly change when you hear someone say your name in a different conversation.

###### Divided attention
Divided attention refers to the ability to distribute our attention and undertake two or more activites simulatenously. It is the attention associated with activites that can be multi-tasked, or anything that requires a low level of cognitive effort. Examples of activites that can be completed with divided attention include walking, talking and driving (if already an experienced driver).

##### Content limitations
Content limitations refer to the ability for individuals to selectively restrict what is let into the content of their consciousness. During NWC, you are typically able to restrict more content from your consciousness, whereas during an ASC you may not be able to block out as much content. For example when in an alcohol-induced state, an individual may not be able to block out feelings and emotions to the same degree as if they were in NWC, often leading them to experience more emotional outbursts.

##### Controlled processes
A controlled process involves conscious, alert awareness and mental effort in which the individual actively focuses their attention on achieving a particular goal. Controlled processes are often required for tasks that involve new experiences in which the brain is not as familar with.The flow of information can be described as _serial_ meaning that information much be processed one after another and not simultaneously. Controlled processes require high levels of cognitive effort to be dedicated to the task. Controlled processes include learning to drive, learning a new board game and rock climbing.

##### Automatic processes
An automatic process requires little conscious awareness and mental effort, minimal attention and does not interfere with the performance of other activities. Automatic processing is most often used for tasks that are familiar to an individual and that are completed often. The flow of information can be described as _parallel_ meaning that during automatic processing an individual may be able to complete two or more tasks simulatenously.

Automatic processing can be illustrated with the Stroop effect, in which participants are shown cards with coloured words on them. Participants are asked to read aloud the colour of each word. In cases where the colour of the word and the word itself are congruent, the participant responsed the quickest. In cases where there was a mismatch of colour and the word (e.g the word 'blue' in red ink) participants often took longer to respond and were incorrect more often. This shows that the automatic process of reading the word often completes quicker than the more complicated task of interpreting the colour of the word (a controlled process).

#### Characteristics of ASCs

##### Time orientation
Estimation and the 'feel' of time is often impaired during an ASC. Individuals may feel that time passes slower or more quickly than the rate at which real time progresses. For example when falling asleep you do not feel as if you have been asleep for several hours, instead you feel as if you were just awake before.

##### Emotional awareness
During ASCs, individuals may find themselves becoming more emotional or erractic in behaviour. They could feel less inhibited and show their emotions more. Unexpected or inappropriate emotional reactions such as laughing at the news that a family member may also occur. Quick swings in mood are also particularly common when in an alcohol-induced state, for example someone may become suddenly agressive for no apparent reason.

##### Perceptual and cognitive distortions
Perceptions and interpretations of surroundings may be distorted during an ASC. For example in a drug-induced state individuals may percieve inanimate objects as being alive and talking (hallucations). Individuals may lose the sense of who they are. ASCs may also enhance senses, making smells stronger, colours more vibrant etc. Cognitive functioning may also be impaired during an ASC, individuals may struggle to think in logical ways or become much less adept at problem-solving. Memory may be impaired.

##### Self-control
Individuals may struggle to stay standing upright or struggle with movements that require coordination such as walking in a straight line. They may become less controlled in their emotions and experience outbursts of sadness or anger. When in a hypnotic state, individuals may become more open to suggestion.

As level of awareness changes, different states of consciousness are able to be experienced. This is possible due to the changing aspect of the consciousness experience. Since level of awareness changes over a spectrum, states of consciousness can be generalised on a spectrum from total awareness (focussed attention, NWC) to a complete lack of awareness (anaesthesised state, unconcious).

#### Normal waking consciousness
Normal waking consciousness or NWC refers to the states of consciousness associated with being awake and aware of our thoughts, memories, feelings and the sensations we are experiencing from the outside world.

#### Altered states of consciousness
- Daydreaming
- Alcohol-induced state
- Sleep, "purpose of sleep, characteristics and patterns of the stages of sleep including rapid eye movement (REM) and the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stages of sleep" - vcaa

### Sleep

#### Purpose of sleep
The purpose of sleep is a topic in which there are two major theories. Restorative theories that propose that sleep is used to restore and repair the body and survial theories, which propose that sleep is used as a tool that was evolved to restrict activity during times of day when an animal may be more vulunerable.

There is limited evidence for both theories and there are no definite answers to the reasons fro sleep, although both theories provide insights for possiblities as to why we sleep.

##### Survival theories
Survival theories are also known as adaptive, evolutionary, preservation and protective theories. They revolve around the idea that while asleep animals are less likely to be spotted by predators when moving around. Once an organism has met all the needs for eating, drinking caring for its young, according to survival theories, it will spend the rest of the time inactive.

Supporting evidence for survival theories can be shown by the existing sleep patterns for various species and the characteristics of those species. For example, animals with fewer predators like lions and gorillas typically sleep longer (up to 15 hours). Animals which require more time to eat suffecient amounts of food like cattle and horses and are usually less agile will spend more time alert and awake (usually sleeping only 4 hours).

Considering this from a human perspective, it is possible that humans would sleep at night due to poor eyesight during the night. It may of been safer to sleep in a cave or under shelter than to attempt to find food.

##### Restorative theories
According to restorative theories, sleep proides an opportunity for the body to replenish the stores of energy that have been depleted during the day. However, recovery that takes place is not only physiologically but also psychological. The main physiological benefits occur during NREM sleep, while REM sleep is associated with psychological repair, including memory consolidation and continuing cognitive robustness.

Evidence for the physiological restorative nature of sleep can be given by Shapiro et al., 1981 which showed that ultra-marathon runners spent a extra 90 minutes asleep over a control group, and additionally tended to stay in slow wave sleep for a longer period of time.

methods used to study the level of alertness in normal waking consciousness and the stages of sleep:
- polysomnography

measurement of physiological responses including electroencephalograph (EEG), electromyograph (EMG), electro-oculargraph (EOG), heart rate, body temperature and galvanic skin response (GSR)
- eeg
- eog
- emg
- gsr

the use of sleep laboratories, video monitoring and self reports
the effects of total and partial sleep depreviation:
- loss of REM and NREM sleep
- sleep recovery patterns including amount of sleep required, REM rebound and microsleeps
- sleep-wake cycle shifts during adolescence compared with child and adult sleep including delayed onset of sleep and need for sleep

### Can REM sleep be removed from sleep?

A case study of a man named Y.H. in 1996 by researchers at Yale University yielded a curious case where no REM sleep was observed at all. The mans background in the Israeli Army led to schrapnel becoming embedded within the Pons, a particular area of the brain stem. It is thought as a result of this that the Pons is a key area in the signalling of REM sleep. On a typically night Y.H. was found to spend approximately 2-5% of his night in REM sleep compared to 20% in neurotypical adults. However, Y.H. reports that he sleeps well and feels refreshed. The cause for Y.H. to be brought into a sleep lab in the first place was due to his episodes of shouting loudly after awaking in the night. These were later identified to be a result of **night terrors** which occur in NREM stages 3&4.

### Why do we dream? (Hobson and McCarley's activation-synthesis theory)

American psychologists Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley (1977) proposed that the reticular activating system (RAS) and the Pons play a role in the temporary paralysis experienced during sleep. They attribute the disjointed and illogical nature of dreams to the random activation that occurs within the brain stem.

## Brain

### Structure of the brain

At the core of the brain is what is known as the old brain. While still used it is the most generic and oldest part of the brain still present in humans. The limbic system (also known as the midbrain), consisting of the amygdala and hippocampus, is responsible for the regulation of mood and memory consolidation. Finally the outermost layer of the brain is known as the cerebral cortex, and is the main distinguishing feature that differs humans from other animals.

For the purpose of studying and VCE the cerebral cortex is typically split up into four topological sections; the front, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes.

![The four lobes of the brain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Gray728.svg)

### Frontal lobe

The frontal lobe is positioned just behind the forehead and is the largest by volume of the four lobes.

#### Primary motor cortex

The primary motor cortex (PMC) is position towards the **back of the frontal lobe** adjacent to the parietal lobe. It is responsible for the communication and control of voluntary movements.

![Slice of the PMC](http://brainconnection.brainhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/1b.gif)

Throughout the slice of the primary motor cortex, different area control different muscles in the body. Generally the larger the portion of the primary motor cortex devoted to a particular area, the greater the control of that muscle. For example the hands have a disproportionately large number of neurons, indicating very fine control.

It's also notable that the lower a muscle is on the body, the higher up it is in the primary motor cortex.

As with numerous other sections of the brain, the primary motor cortex is **contralaterally organised**, meaning the primary motor cortex in the left cerebral hemisphere controls the right side of the body and vice versa.

#### Broca's area

Broca's area, located slightly forward from the primary motor cortex, is responsible for **production of articulate speech** that is clear and fluent. Specifically, Broca's area has been identified as the major area for organising electrical signals for the control of the muscles around the face used while talking.

For the purposes of VCE, Broca's area is only found in the **left cerebral hemisphere**.

Aside from motor control of the mouth, Broca's area has also been linked to **understanding grammar** and sentence structure as well as syntactic elements such as conjunctions and prepositions.

Stores articulation codes for speech.

##### Broca's aphasia

Damage to Broca's area from, for example a stroke, may lead to **Broca's aphasia**. Broca's aphasia is characterised by the **impediment of the production of speech**. Speech will typically lack grammar and predominantly consist of **nouns and verbs**. In some cases comprehension can be impaired, and the condition also affects the ability to understand written grammar.

**Simple words** (that have had repeated stimulation before damage to Broca's area) are much easier to say (e.g yes and no) as opposed to less used words (which have not had as much repeated stimulation through those pathways).

#### Association areas

Typically the frontal lobe is associated with higher order operations and **complex mental functions**. This includes planning, decision making, problem solving and conscious movement.

Other functions of the frontal lobe include **attention, personality and mood, control of emotion** and expression of emotional behaviour. Some of this and particularly mood is a result of the high concerntration of dopamine sensitive neurons, which are key neurotransmitters for reward, attention and short-term memory.

### Parietal lobe

The parietal lobe is located behind the frontal lobe and above the occipital lobe, at the top of the skull.

#### Primary somatosensory cortex

Located in the postcentral gyrus, the primary somatosensory cortex is the key processing area for sensation and tactile perception. This areas control is **contralateral**.

![A cortical sensory homunculus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/1421_Sensory_Homunculus.jpg/482px-1421_Sensory_Homunculus.jpg)

In a similar way to the primary motor cortex, neurons along the primary somatosensory cortex correspond to parts of the body with the lower body parts at the top of the cortical tissue and vice versa.

The size of cortical area devoted to a particular body part is roughly proportionate to the density of nerves in that body part.

#### Association areas

The association areas and general functions of the parietal lobe include **perception of our position in space** (after inclusion of information from the PMC and PAC), **visual attention and spatial reasoning** (estimation of distance from objects).

Typically spatial reasoning only occurs on the right parietal lobe, as a result of damage to right parietal lobe, severe impairment of spatial reasoning can lead to **spatial neglect**.

### Temporal lobe

The temporal lobe is located below the parietal lobe and forward of the occipital lobe. It primarily functions as an area for **auditory perception**, but also as a result of including the **hippocampus** plays an important role in aspects of visual perception. The temporal lobe is also crucial for **understanding spoken and written material**.

- Emotional aspects of memory
- Aspects of visual perception such as ability to identify objects and recognise faces
- Emotional processing

#### Primary auditory cortex

![Brodman areas 41 & 42 of the human brain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/81/Brodmann_41_42.png)

Just below the central sulcus (intersection between the frontal and parietal lobe) and forward of Wernicke's area is the primary auditory cortex (PAC). The primary auditory cortex's main role is **receive amplify and interpret sounds** from both ears.

Within the PAC are **feature detectors** which are specialised to specific frequencies (pitch) and amplitudes (volume). These feature detectors are present in different areas of the PAC.

In the PAC, the hemispheres both tend to process different types of sounds. **Verbal sounds** are primarily processed in the **left hemisphere** while **non-verbal** sounds are primarily processed in the **right hemisphere**. However, there tends to be more overlap between hemispheres when processing non-verbal sounds.

#### Werenicke's area

Wernicke's area, located in the **left temporal lobe** under the primary auditory cortex, is the key area in which **comprehension of language interpretation** occurs (both spoken and written).

Speech from patients with Wernicke's aphasia grammatically correct just is meaningful and lacks any proper sense.

Damage to Werenicke's area can result in impediment in speech and listening skills, specifically Wernicke's aphasia (also known as fluent aphasia). Patients with Wernicke's aphasia will often find themselves confused when trying to understand what other people are saying and will often speak gibberish.

Wernicke's aphasia also impedes on the ability for an individual to add meaning to their own speech.

#### Hippocampus

![A view of the hippocampus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Hippocampus_small.gif)

The hippocampus' main attributed role is aiding in the consolidation and retrieval of memory.

#### Amygdala

![A view of the Amygdala](https://sccpsy101.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/amygdala.gif)

The amygdala is responsible in aiding the regulation of mood. It's studied role is concerning reactions to fear, as fear requires an immediate response as opposed to other emotions which can be put off.

The amygdala integrates sensory information from the PVC, PAC and PSC, and gives outputs to other systems like the sympathetic nervous system in instances of fear, to highten heartrate, blood pressure and other factors.

#### Association areas

The temporal lobe is heavily responsible for memory related functions. This includes **semantic, procedural and episodic memory**. Also related to memory, the temporal lobe aids in **identification and recognition of objects and faces.**

Determining appropriate **emotional responses to stimuli** from sensory information and memories is another function of the temporal lobe.

### Occipital lobe

The occipital lobe is positioned at the very back of the cerebral cortex. While the occipital lobe is almost exclusively committed to sight, other areas like the temporal and parietal lobes also play a part in visual perception.

#### Primary visual cortex

The primary visual cortex (PVC) is the key area in the **processing and recognition of features in vision.** Information from each retina is split up and sent to both hemispheres for processing. Vision from the right visual field (right side of each retina) is sent to the left hemisphere and vice versa **(contralateral organisation).**

Another key feature of the primary visual cortex are **feature detector cells**. These specialised cells spot out specific shapes and textures from the visual field such and corners and lines.

#### Association area

Interaction with primary visual cortex to **select, organise and integrate visual information** occurs throughout the association areas. Interaction with other lobes also occurs to ensure that visual information is **integrated with the sound, memory and language.**

#### Broca's aphasia vs. Werenicke's aphasia

| | Broca's aphasia | Werenicke's aphasia |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sentence structure | Mainly verbs and nouns | Mostly function words |
| Example of sentence | "Catch train home now" | "I called mother on the TV and did not understand the door" |
| Speech patterns | Speech requires effort and is slow and drawn out | Speech is effortless |
| Meaningfulness of speech | Meaningful | Characeristically incoherent |
| Patient awareness | Patient is aware of condition | Patient is not aware of condition |
| Understanding of spoken/written word | Acceptable | Difficulty with both |
| Location of brain damage | Left hemisphere near the motor cortex | Left hemisphere near the parietal lobe |
| Fluency | Non-fluent, slow, deliberate and effortful | Very fluent but makes no sense |
| Repetition of words | Moderate to severe | Mild to moderate |
| Grammar | Difficulty understanding and using grammar | Intact |

### Split brain studies

#### Why complete split brain studies?

Historically, split brain studies were used in order to treat epilepsy. During an epileptic seizure, random electrical pulses fire throughout the brain. Neurologists were able to limit this electrical interference in severe cases by severing the corpus callosum so as to *cage* the electrical noise in one hemisphere of the brain.

#### What has been learnt from split-brain studies?

It was observed that strange changes occured in the cognition of patients that had a *split-brain*. Research completed by *Roger Sperry* suggested that visual information was organised in a contralateral fashion. It was also noted that during an experiment in which patients could not name objects, they could identify them by touch.

### Hemispheric specialisation
#### Left hemisphere

- Verbal tasks
- Logical reasoning
- Controlling movements and receiving and processing sensations from the right side of the body
- Analysis of information

#### Right hemisphere

- Non-verbal tasks
- Thinking holistically globally
- Processing spatial information
- Emotion recognition
- Understanding metaphors and abstract concepts
- Controlling movements and receiving and processing sensations from the left side of the body


Example question: Name one specialiation of the left hemisphere of the brain.
→ Controlling the movements and receiving the sensations from the right side of the body.
→ This is the *least* controversial answer, and therefore the hardest to argue against.

## Nervous system

![A summary of the composition of the nervous system](http://phoenixrising.me/wp-content/uploads/the-autonomic-nervous-system.jpg)

### The central nervous system

Composed by the spinal cord and the brain, the central nervous system (CNS) is the system that allows responses to external events and general control of the body.

#### Spinal cord

The spinal cord's main function is to communication messages between the *peripheral nervous system* and the brain.

Through the spine, a column of nerve fibers extends through the vertebrae. **Efferent fibers carry motor information** while **afferent fibers carry sensory information.**

The spinal cord is also able to respond to sensation without the need of processing in the brain. These actions are called **reflex responses.** Examples of reflex responses are the breathing, the knee jerk response, or any response made to painful sensory input.

### Peripheral nervous system

The peripehral nervous system (PNS) is composed of two branches. The somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.

#### Somatic nervous system

The somatic nervous system is a subdivision of the PNS. The PNS carries motor information from the CNS to muscles, organs and other parts of the body as well as sensory information to the CNS.

The pathways these messages are carried along while physically close are seperate. Motor information is carried along efferent neurons while sensory information is carried along afferent neurons. Both of these pathways run through the spinal cord. These pathways tend to be further broken down into specific groups such as being related to touch or smell.

The somatic nervous system is responsible for the **control of any conscious movement.** This includes anything form running a 100m sprint to turning the page of a book. These actions are created and sent out from the primary motor cortex in the frontal lobe of the brain.

Anything you feel is generally a result of the somatic nervous system as well. The sensation of warmth in your hands when sitting by a fire is communicated from your hands via afferent neurons to the primary somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe of the brain.

#### Autonomic nervous system

While the somatic nervous system tends to be associated with functions that you are immediately aware of, the autonomic nervous system as its name suggests, controls bodily functions that are not conscious. The autonomic nervous system has two components, the sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system.

##### Sympathetic nervous system

The sympathetic nervous system is the nervous system that is utilised when responding to threatening situations. The purpose of this system is to prepare the body to either fight the threat or flee, or **vigorous activity**.

##### Parasympathetic nervous system

While the sympathetic nervous system is concerned with controlling the body in dangerous or survival situations, the parasympathetic nervous system **controls the body under regular conditions.** It's actions tend to undo the actions of the sympathetic nervous, this includes contraction of the pupils, increased salivation and slowing down heartrate.

The general role of the parasympathetic nervous system is to bring the body to homeostasis and keep it there. **Homeostasis** is the ability of the body to maintain a stable psychological environment. This is acheived by keeping certain biological variables within a narrow range called **set points.** Examples of set points include heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature.

##### Comparison of actions made by the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems

| Body part | Function | Sympathetic action | Parasympathetic action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adrenal glands | Secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine from the medulla | Increased secretion | Decreased secretion |
| Pupils | Regulate the amount of light entering the eye | Dilation | Contraction |
| Heart | Pump blood around the body | Increased HR | Decreased HR |
| Bronchioles of lungs | Allow diffusion of oxygen into blood | Dilation | Contraction |
| Liver | Regulates blood sugar | Increased blood sugar | Decreased blood sugar |
| Liver | Produces bile to aid digestion | Decreased bile production | Increased bile production |
| Sweat glands | Regulate temperature | Increased perspiration | Decreased perspiration |
| Genitals | Reproduction | Excitement | Relaxation |
| Salivary glands | Digestion | Decreased salivation | Increased salivation |

### General functions of areas

#### Cerebral lobes

| Lobe | Roles |
| --- | --- |
| Frontal lobe | Conscious movement, problem solving, planning, personality, production of articulate speech |
| Parietal lobe | Sensation of pain, pressure, touch, spatial reasoning, visual perception and recognition |
| Occipital lobe | Processing of visual information, movement and colour recognition |
| Temporal lobe | Responsible for the consilidation of memory, interpretation of smells and sounds, facial recognition |

#### Hemispheres of the brain

| Left hemisphere | Right hemisphere |
| --- | --- |
| Receives, analyses and interprets sensation from the right side of the body | Receives, analyses and interprets sensation from the left side of the body |
| Controls voluntary movements for skeletal muscles on the right side of the body | Controls voluntary movements for skeletal muscles on the left side of the body |
| Verbal functions such as comprehension and production of meaningful language, reading, writing | Spatial perception and visual thinking |
| Analysis and analytic functions, planning, problem solving | Appreciation of art and music (Non-verbal) |
| Logical reasoning | Recognition of emotion and body language |
